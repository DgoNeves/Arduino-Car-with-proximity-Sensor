# Arduino car with proximity sensor

This project was made to complete a subject.
Here's a quick guide to make the same project but hopefully it'll work out better than my own.

## Materials

* [WeMos ESP 8266 D1 Mini](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/D1-mini-V2-Mini-NodeMcu-4M-bytes-Lua-WIFI-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based-ESP8266/32706031465.html?spm=2114.10010308.1000016.1.uzQEtv&isOrigTitle=true)
* [Servo Motor SG90 9G](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1piece-RC-Mini-Micro-9g-Servo-SG90-For-RC-250-450-6CH-Helicopter-Airplane-Aeroplane-Kds/32377810972.html?spm=2114.10010308.1000016.1.48meDR&isOrigTitle=true)
* [Support Block Coupler Box 8 Battery AA](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/Brand-New-Support-Block-Coupler-Box-8-Battery-AA-Battery-for-RC-Helicopter/32718513575.html?spm=2114.10010308.1000016.1.Xtxpqz&isOrigTitle=true) - **Advice** use 4.5V batteries instead of 1.5V, they're more powerful and last longer.
* [HC-SR04](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/New-Ultrasonic-Module-HC-SR04-Distance-Measuring-Transducer-Sensor-for-for-Ar/1859102668.html?spm=2114.10010308.1000016.1.925qY2&isOrigTitle=true)
* [5V Relay](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/5V-Relay-Module-1-Channel-Low-level-for-SCM-Household-Appliance-Control-FREE-SHIPPING-For-Arduino/1885956518.html?spm=2114.10010308.1000016.1.hiWjxJ&isOrigTitle=true)
* [DC Motor](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/Wholesale-550-Motor-Cooling-Fan-Inside-22000rpm-Strong-Magnetic-Motor-For-DIY-Model-High-Speed-Motor/32377399640.html?spm=2114.10010308.1000016.1.37I7pF&isOrigTitle=true)
* Legos - **Advice** use a 3D printer to build your own pieces if possible.

## Car V1

This version is the version I used, here's the schematics:

## Car V2

I've also made another schematic for an improvement, this way you can make the car go forward and backwards when it has an obstacle, thanks to the 2nd relay.

## Credits

The advices we're all from my [teacher](https://github.com/mariolpantunes).

Thanks to my colleages Helder Fonseca and Ricardo Pereira I could not have made it without them!
